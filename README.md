# Power Strip

The Z-Wave certified Power Strip application shows an extension block implementation used to turn on 
several devices that are connected to power. Examples include lights, appliances, etc.

The Power Strip Z-Wave certified application implements several endpoints, which can be controlled 
individually.

The Power Strip application is based on:

types/events:
- Power Management
  - Overload detected (both endpoint 1 and 2)

## Association Groups

The following three tables show the available association groups for Z-Wave and Z-Wave Long 
Range respectively.
Backward compatibility for non-Multi Channel devices forces the root device AGI table to contain all the 
association groups mentioned in each of the endpoints AGI tables except from group 1, the Lifeline 
group.

## Usage of Buttons and LED Status

We are differentiating four different types of button presses. The following types are the same for the BTN0 and BTN1 on the WSTK board. The duration values can be configured under the config directory in app_button_press_config.h file in each generated application/project.

Please note external wakeup is not supported on button 1 in case of brd2603a and brd2603b.

## Firmware Update

This section will describe backward compatibility when upgrading the Power Strip application from one SDK to a newer version. 

## CLI Support
Please note the zw_cli_common component will modify the power consumption in case of sleeping applications. Like door lock keypad, sensor pir or multilevel sensor. CLI cannot work with sleep mode, after a reset the application stays awake until the user issues the enable_sleeping command. From that point CLI won't work  and sleep mode will be reached until the next reset.
